# Configuration for the line-by-line tracer.

# A list of regex patterns. Scripts whose URL matches any of these patterns
# will be "blackboxed" by the debugger. The tracer will not step into them.
# This is useful for ignoring libraries, node internals, or utility files.
blacklist_patterns:
  # Ignore all node internal modules (e.g., 'path', 'fs')
  - "^node:.*"
  # Ignore files inside any node_modules directory
  - "/node_modules/"
  # Ignore our specific utility file for testing purposes
  - "test_utils.js"
